## Overview

Asciiquarium is a fun, animated aquarium rendered entirely in ASCII art for your terminal. Watch fish, sharks, whales, submarines, and more swim across your screen!

## Features

- Animated ASCII art aquarium in your terminal
- Multiple fish species, sharks, whales, submarines, ships, ducks, dolphins, and more
- Randomized marine life and events
- Colorful display (if your terminal supports it)
- Classic mode for original species only

## Installation

Asciiquarium is a single Perl script. To install:

1. **Download the script:**
   Place `asciiquarium` in a directory of your choice (e.g., `/usr/local/bin` or `/usr/local/games`).

2. **Make it executable:**
   ```sh
   chmod +x asciiquarium
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   - **Term::Animation** (requires **Curses**)
   - On Ubuntu/Debian:
     ```sh
     sudo apt-get install libcurses-perl
     sudo cpan Term::Animation
     ```
   - On other systems, use CPAN or your package manager to install `Curses` and `Term::Animation`.

## Usage

Run the program in your terminal:

```sh
./asciiquarium
```

### Command Line Options

- `-c` : Classic mode (only original species from Asciiquarium 1.0)

### Controls (while running)

- `q` : Quit
- `r` : Redraw (recreates all entities)
- `p` : Pause/unpause animation

## Troubleshooting

- **Windows is not supported** (unless using Cygwin with curses).
- If you see errors about missing modules, install them via CPAN:
  ```sh
  cpan Curses
  cpan Term::Animation
  ```
- Make sure your terminal supports colors for best experience.
